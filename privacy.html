                    The author accepts no responsibility for the topicality, correctness, completeness or
                    quality of the information provided. Liability claims against the author, which refer to
                    material or non-material damages, which have been caused by the use or non-use of the
                    information provided or by the use of incorrect and incomplete information, are
                    fundamentally excluded, provided that there is no demonstrable intentional or
                    grossly negligent fault on the part of the author. The author expressly reserves
                    the right to change, supplement or delete parts of the pages or the entire offer
                    without separate announcement or to discontinue the publication temporarily or permanently.</p>

                    <h6>References and links</h6>

                    which are outside the author's area of responsibility, a liability obligation would only
                    come into force in the event that the author is aware of the contents and it would be
                    technically possible and reasonable for him to prevent use in the event of illegal

                    the provider of the page to which reference is made shall be solely liable, not the
                    person who merely refers to the respective publication via links.</p>

                    <p>If the opportunity for the input of personal or business data (email addresses, name, addresses)
                    is given, the input of these data takes place voluntarily. Further information is
                    available in our privacy and cookie policy.</p>

                    <h6>Validity of this disclaimer</h6>
